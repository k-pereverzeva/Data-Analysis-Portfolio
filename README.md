# Karina Pereverzeva's Data Analysis Portfolio

Welcome to my data analysis portfolio! My name is Karina Pereverzeva, and I'm an aspiring **Data analyst**. On this Github repository, you'll find various projects I have worked on to demonstrate my skills, share my insights and progress, and track my growth in the field of data analysis.

## About Me

I'm a recent graduate from the University of Warsaw, where I earned my Bachelor's degree in Biotechnology. During my time in university, I was fortunate to develop a strong foundation in statistics and data analysis. But more than that, I found myself truly captivated by the power of data.

In my diploma thesis, I created a database and analyzed its contents to gain valuable insights. This experience sparked a deep passion within me, and I've been constantly working to improve my skills ever since. I've been taking online courses, completing assignments, and dedicating myself to the exciting world of data analysis.

## Projects

Here are some of the data analysis projects I have worked on:

* [New Product Sales Methods Analysis](Sales-Methods-Analysis/sales_methods_analysis_code.ipynb): The goal of the project was to determine the most effective sales approach for a new line of office stationery by comparing the results of three different sales strategies - targeted email, phone calls, and a combination of both. 
Using Python and data visualization libraries, I analyzed the sales data from the three different sales strategies and compared their results. I also created a [report](Sales-Methods-Analysis/sales_method_analysis_report.ipynb) and presentation summarizing my findings.

## Skills

* Data cleaning, wrangling, and preprocessing with Python and SQL
* Data exploration with Python and SQL
* Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
* Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing with Scipy
