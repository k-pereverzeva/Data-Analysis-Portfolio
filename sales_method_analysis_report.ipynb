It summarizes the results obtained from the analysis and provides recommendations for the company.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"36589583-b6db-4607-a009-783f9ed58a2d"},{"source":"## Data validation\n\nThe dataset contains **15000 rows and 8 columns** before cleaning and validataion. I have validated all the columns against the criteria in the dataset table:\n\n- **week:** Weeks from 1 to 6, as expected. No cleaning is needed.\n- **sales_method:** There were different versions of methods' names. I standartized them to 'call', 'email' and 'email + call'.\n- **customer_id:** 15000 unique values. No cleaning is needed.\n- **nb_sold:** 10 unique values between 7 and 16. No cleaning is needed.\n- **revenue:** There are 1074 missing values in the dataset. I have considered two potential approaches to handle this data. Since it accounts for 7% of all data, one option is to replace the missing values with the median for each method. However, this could potentially affect the distribution of revenue. Another approach is to remove the rows with missing data. Although it involves removing a significant amount of data, I am unsure why there are missing values in the revenue column. I didn't find any patterns so it's **Missing Completely at Random** data. It could be due to uncompleted transactions or returns, and so removing those rows may be a better option. So I removed those rows, leaving 13926 rows of data.\n- **years_as_customer:**  I removed rows where the number of years as customer was bigger then number of years company existed. This was 2 rows, leaving 13924 rows of data.\n- **nb_site_visits:** 27 unique values between 12 and 41. No cleaning is needed.\n- **state:** 50 unique names of states. No cleaning is needed.\n\nAfter the data validation, the dataset contains **13924 rows and 8 columns** without missing values.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"34c5566b-86bd-474a-a330-0fca31f760d9"},{"source":"## What differences are there between the sales method groups?","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"55b94679-2599-465c-9b6f-bfb73f5052e5"},{"source":"During the six weeks since the launch of the new product, the **email** approach had the highest number of customers,  approximately **50%**, with 6921 customers.

However, I am uncertain whether specific products were bought using different approaches, or if different types of products were sold using different sales methods.

As for the email and call method, the revenue gradually increased, with a faster growth observed after the call made in the second week.

However, the distribution for the email and call method is slightly left-skewed.

The previous chart also showed a gradual increase in revenue over time, which could support this theory.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"eb7ec02c-4cc2-41e1-8e6a-e1ea372b4795"},{"source":"![rev_nb_visits (1)](/plots/rev_nb_visits%20(1).png)","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"6ad7afa3-ba1f-4f26-a898-ebc85844a635"},{"source":"The customers who have been buying from us for 1 year are the most active and bring in the most revenue, while revenue decreases as the number of years as a customer increases for each method.

While we don't have specific numbers for the amount of time spent on each customer for each approach, we can make some assumptions based on the information provided. It appears that the most time-consuming method is the call approach, as it takes an average of 30 minutes per customer. The email and call approach is likely the next most time-consuming, with email requiring relatively little work from the team and the call taking around 10 minutes per customer. Finally, the least time-consuming approach is likely the email method. \n\nBased on our data, we can see that the call method, which takes the most time with an average of 30 minutes per customer, generates an average price of 5`$`. On the other hand, the email method, which requires the least amount of time, generates an average price of 10`$`. The email and call method, which falls somewhere in between in terms of time spent, generates an average price of 15`$`. Depending on the resources available to our company, the most effective approach can be chosen based on this metric.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"9002a78b-5435-47cf-ab51-6d9d0d4db451"},{"source":"## Recommendation\n\nI have recommendations for two different possibilities:\n\n1. **Different types of products were sold using different sales methods**\n\n\tI suggest collecting data on each type of product sold using each sales method and tracking the amount of time spent on each approach. This will enable us to conduct the analysis again with more granular data.\n    \n    `\n    `\n2. **Specific products were bought using different approaches**\n\n\tThe **call strategy** requires a significant amount of time and resources, it may not be the most cost-effective strategy for lower-priced products. So I would not recommend continuing to use this approach.\n\n\tIf the goal is to maximize revenue while minimizing costs, it may be best to choose the **email strategy** as it generated a high revenue per item sold and required very little work from the team.\n\n\tIf resources are available, the **email and call strategy** may also be effective as it generated the highest revenue per item sold.\n\n**Other recomendations:**\n1. I would suggest to pay attention to customers who have been with us for longer periods and find ways to keep them engaged and interested in our products. This could include offering special promotions or discounts, providing personalized recommendations, or improving the overall customer experience.\n2. Additionally, to increase our customer base in states with fewer customers, we should focus our marketing efforts on those areas.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"0e013e8f-52e3-4341-acb3-5ee7a21caf47"}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
